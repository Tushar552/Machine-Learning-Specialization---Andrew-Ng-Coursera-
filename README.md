### **Project 1: Used Car Price Prediction**

#### **Problem Statement**

The used car market is a dynamic and highly competitive industry where pricing plays a crucial role in both sales and customer satisfaction. The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that could accurately estimate the selling price of used cars based on various features such as the car's age, mileage, brand, and other relevant attributes. By creating such a model, car dealers and buyers can make more informed decisions, leading to better pricing strategies and more efficient transactions.

#### **Data Collection**

The dataset used for this project was sourced from a reputable online platform that aggregates data on used cars. It contained a variety of features, including:

- **Car Age**: The number of years since the car was manufactured.
- **Mileage**: The total distance the car has been driven, usually measured in kilometers or miles.
- **Brand and Model**: The make and model of the car, which can significantly influence its resale value.
- **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., petrol, diesel, electric).
- **Transmission Type**: Whether the car has a manual or automatic transmission.
- **Seller Type**: Whether the car is being sold by an individual or a dealership.
- **Price**: The target variable representing the car's selling price.

This dataset provided a comprehensive view of the factors that typically influence the price of used cars.

#### **Data Preprocessing**

Before building the predictive model, the dataset underwent extensive preprocessing to ensure accuracy and reliability:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in the dataset were imputed using appropriate statistical techniques, such as mean imputation for numerical features and mode imputation for categorical features.
- **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Outliers that could skew the model's predictions were identified and removed using interquartile range (IQR) methods and visual inspection.
- **Feature Encoding**: Categorical variables, such as brand and fuel type, were converted into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Continuous variables like mileage and age were scaled to normalize their range, making the model more efficient and reducing biases in learning.
- **Train-Test Split**: The data was split into training and testing sets, typically at an 80-20 ratio, to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

#### **Model Building**

Several machine learning algorithms were explored to build the predictive model:

- **Linear Regression**: This model was initially chosen due to its simplicity and interpretability. It provided a baseline for comparison against more complex models.
- **Decision Trees**: Decision Trees were used for their ability to model non-linear relationships and handle categorical data without requiring extensive preprocessing.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method, Random Forest, was employed to improve prediction accuracy by reducing overfitting that might occur with a single decision tree.
- **XGBoost**: XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, was tested for its ability to handle complex datasets and deliver high predictive performance.

Each model was trained on the training dataset and evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²) to measure its accuracy.

#### **Results**

After evaluating all models, the **Random Forest** model provided the best performance with the following metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: X
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Y
- **R-squared (R²)**: Z

The model accurately captured the relationship between the car's attributes and its selling price, offering valuable insights for pricing strategies.

#### **Conclusion**

The Used Car Price Prediction project successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning in the automotive industry. By accurately predicting car prices, the model can help sellers and buyers make informed decisions, ultimately leading to a more efficient market. Future work could involve refining the model with more diverse datasets and integrating additional features like regional market trends or economic indicators.
