### **Project 2: Heart Failure Disease Prediction**

#### **Problem Statement**

Heart failure is a severe medical condition where the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, leading to various health complications and potentially fatal outcomes. Early detection of heart failure can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention and treatment. The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that can identify patients at risk of heart failure based on medical data such as age, blood pressure, and other vital health indicators. The model aimed to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding patient care and treatment plans.

#### **Data Collection**

The dataset used for this project was obtained from a medical research database that compiled information on heart failure patients. The dataset included the following key features:

- **Age**: The age of the patient.
- **Anaemia**: Whether the patient has anaemia (a condition marked by a deficiency of red blood cells).
- **High Blood Pressure**: Indicates if the patient has high blood pressure.
- **Diabetes**: Whether the patient is diabetic.
- **Smoking**: Indicates if the patient is a smoker.
- **Serum Creatinine**: Level of creatinine in the blood, which reflects kidney function.
- **Ejection Fraction**: Percentage of blood leaving the heart each time it contracts.
- **Serum Sodium**: Sodium levels in the blood.
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient.
- **Platelets**: Platelet count in the blood.
- **Time**: Follow-up period (days).
- **DEATH_EVENT**: Target variable indicating whether the patient experienced a fatal event.

This dataset provided a comprehensive view of various health indicators that are typically associated with heart failure.

#### **Data Preprocessing**

To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the predictive model, the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps:

- **Handling Missing Values**: The dataset was checked for missing values, and any gaps were filled using mean or median imputation for numerical features. Categorical features were handled using mode imputation.
- **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Outliers that could distort the model's predictions were identified using statistical methods and removed to enhance model performance.
- **Feature Encoding**: Categorical variables such as gender and smoking status were converted into numerical values using label encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Continuous variables like serum creatinine and ejection fraction were scaled to standardize their ranges, which is essential for models sensitive to feature scaling, such as logistic regression.
- **Train-Test Split**: The data was split into training and testing sets in an 80-20 ratio to evaluate the model's generalization capabilities.

#### **Model Building**

Several machine learning algorithms were explored to develop the predictive model for heart failure detection:

- **Logistic Regression**: This was chosen for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks. It provided a straightforward baseline model.
- **Decision Tree**: Used for its ability to model complex relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Implemented for its robustness in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring effective classification.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Evaluated for its simplicity and effectiveness in small datasets.
- **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm that often delivers superior performance in classification tasks.

Each model was trained on the training dataset and evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) to measure its performance.

#### **Results**

After evaluating all models, the **XGBoost** model provided the best performance with the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: X%
- **Precision**: Y%
- **Recall**: Z%
- **F1-Score**: W
- **AUC**: V

The XGBoost model effectively identified patients at risk of heart failure, offering high precision and recall, which are crucial in medical diagnoses.

#### **Conclusion**

The Heart Failure Disease Prediction project demonstrated the potential of machine learning in the healthcare sector. By accurately predicting heart failure risks, the model can assist healthcare professionals in making timely decisions, potentially saving lives. Future work could involve incorporating more diverse datasets, exploring additional features, and refining the model to enhance its predictive capabilities.
